# Odin Recipes

Welcome to my **Odin Recipes** project!

This is a simple website built as part of [The Odin Project]Foundations curriculum. The goal of this project is to create a basic HTML website that showcases a few of my favorite recipes.

##  Project Overview

The website consists of:
- A homepage that links to individual recipe pages
- Multiple recipe pages containing:
  - Recipe titles
  - Images
  - Ingredients list
  - Step-by-step preparation instructions

##  Skills Demonstrated

By completing this project, I have demonstrated the following foundational web development skills:

- Writing clean, semantic HTML
- Structuring content into multiple linked pages
- Organizing a simple project folder
- Using Git for version control
- Creating and managing a GitHub repository
- Understanding basic web navigation and links

## ðŸš€What's Next?

In future stages of The Odin Project, Iâ€™ll continue to build on this by learning about CSS, JavaScript, and creating more complex and interactive web applications.
